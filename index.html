        <div id="about">
            <p>The story of Summerville Rovers is well documented both in Print & Picture. This is mainly down to the
                foresight of our founding members Aidan Corr & Charlie Elliott. Aidan has documented our first 40 years
                in existence with his two publications, "Silver Jubilee Special" and "40th Anniversary Club History",
                and Charlie has amassed a large collection of photographs which have been added to by a succession of
                Club officials.

                We hope the contents of this website will give enjoyment and bring back great memories to all those who
                have been associated with Summerville Rovers over the past 60+ years. Many of our former members now
                live
                in far away places and we hope you enjoy the journey down memory lane. The website also provides
                information on the present day activities of the club. If you would like to communicate with the club or
                the members of the club, go to our Contact Us page, we would be delighted to hear from you.
